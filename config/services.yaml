# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.
# Files in the packages/ subdirectory configure your dependencies.

# Put parameters here that don't need to change on each machine where the app is deployed

parameters:

services:
    # default configuration for services in *this* file
    _defaults:
        autowire: true      # Automatically injects dependencies in your services.
        autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.

    # makes classes in src/ available to be used as services
    # this creates a service per class whose id is the fully-qualified class name
    App\:
        resource: '../src/'

    App\Responder\TwigResponderInterface:

    # controllers are imported separately to make sure services can be injected
    # as action arguments even if you don't extend any base controller class

        resource: '../src/Action/'
        tags: ['controller.service_arguments']

    # add more service definitions when explicit configuration is needed
